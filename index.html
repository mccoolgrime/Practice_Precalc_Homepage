            <h1>Speaking in Precalculus with Ms. M-G</h1>
            <p>Mathematics is a language that both shapes and describes powerful stories about the world around us through engineering, biomedical science, computer programming, data analysis and countless other fields. Precalculus is an immersion program. Our goal here is to give you the language skills to be successful anywhere you go in the Land of Mathematics. </p>
